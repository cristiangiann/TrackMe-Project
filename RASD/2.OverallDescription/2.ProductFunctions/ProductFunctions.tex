	\subsection{Data4Help}
	
		\subsubsection{User Registration}
		Data4Help will allow individuals to register. These will register by entering all the required information (see R\subs{2}). When registering to Data4Help, an individual will first declare to have read the \ic{Privacy statement} and secondly they will have to accept the \ic{Terms and conditions}, which specifically include their consent to the acquisition and processing of their data, including sensitive ones, by TrackMe.\\
		The \ic{User} registration process will be carried out on the Data4Help application (see Section 3.1.1).

		\subsubsection{Third Party Registration}
		A \ic{Third party} may register to Data4Help including all required information (see R\subs{3}).
		Once \ic{Terms and conditions} have been accepted by the \ic{Third party}, it will be successfully registered to Data4Help.

		\subsubsection{User Data Acquisition}
		Data4Help will acquire \ic{User data} through \ic{Smart wearables}. \\
		\ic{Users} must give consent to the acquisition of their data when registering to Data4Help.\\

		\subsubsection{Third Party Data Request}
		Once a \ic{Third party} is registered to Data4Help, it can request access to \ic{User data} acquired through Data4Help and stored by TrackMe. \ic{Third parties} may request data that refers either to a specific individual - \ic{User data} - or to a group of \ic{Users} identified by common characteristics - \ic{Group data}.\\
		Consent to individual data access is left to the specific \ic{User}, who can either give or deny it to a \ic{Third party} request.\\
		\ic{Group data} will be shared with \ic{Third parties} as long as TrackMe will be able to anonymize it properly (see R\subs{23}).

		\subsubsection{Data Management and Privacy}
		All data acquired through Data4Help will be stored on a database accessible only by TrackMe. At any time, a \ic{User} will be able to revoke the previously given consent to any \ic{Third party} or to TrackMe. Moreover, a \ic{User} may exercise their right to data portability, which means that TrackMe will have to provide them with all the collected data regarding them (see R\subs{32} and R\subs{34}). Finally, \ic{Users} may ask the deletion of all their data stored by TrackMe (see R\subs{33} and R\subs{35}).\\
		By guaranteeing these functions, Data4Help will respect existing general regulations on privacy (e.g. EU GDPR).
	
	\subsection{AutomatedSOS}
		
		\subsubsection{User Subscription}
		All Data4Help \ic{Users} can add AutomatedSOS to their \ic{Services} through Data4Help application (see Section 3.1.1).
		
		\subsubsection{Health Status Monitoring}
		The \ic{Service} will constantly monitor \ic{User}'s health data to verify if it is \ic{Anomalous}.
		
		\subsubsection{Calling an Ambulance}
		In case the health status of a subscribed \ic{User} is considered not to be good, AutomatedSOS will make a call to local emergency services within 5 seconds asking to send an ambulance to the last registered location of the \ic{User}.

	\subsection{Track4Run}
		
		\subsubsection{User Registration}
		Track4Run will be a \ic{Service} used by three different kinds of users: \ic{Organizers}, \ic{Participants} and \ic{Spectators}. \ic{Organizers} will register to Track4Run by filling in all required information in the organizers registration form (see R\subs{41}). \ic{Participants} will enroll in the \ic{Run} through the Data4Help application. \ic{Spectators} may watch a \ic{Run} looking for it through its name or identifier.
		
		\subsubsection{Run Creation and Path Definition}
		\ic{Organizers} can create a \ic{Run}. They will be able to give the \ic{Run} a name, set a date and time the \ic{Run} is going to be held on and define a path for it. Moreover, they may limit the number of \ic{Participants} or decide when to close enrollment (see R\subs{43} and section 3.1.1).
		
		\subsubsection{Display Runners on Map}
		Track4Run will display a map with the real time position of all the \ic{Participants} during a \ic{Run} (see section 3.1.1). \ic{Spectators} may watch a \ic{Run} by inserting its name or identifier. Real time statistics of \ic{Participants} will be shown (e.g. heart rate, rankings).
