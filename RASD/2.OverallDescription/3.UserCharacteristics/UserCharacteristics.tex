				\paragraph{Third parties:}
				Companies or private persons willing, for any reasons, to collect bulk data. Usually the data is used for building services on top of it; in this case it is very important that data is transferred real time. Sometimes it is used just for statistics analysis. In both cases, third parties need that the data is correct and precise.
