			\subsection{Availability}
			The software must offer the maximum availability, granting its service 24/7. The lack of service must be minimal.
			\paragraph{AutomatedSOS}
			AutomatedSOS must be active 24/7. The lack of service is acceptable only if it is due to maintenance. AutomatedSOS users must have received a warning fourty-eight hours before, and they must be noticed again one hour before the service disabling.
			Even in this case, the lack of service must be kept to a minimum.
