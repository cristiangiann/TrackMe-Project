\section{Software System Attributes}
			
			\subsection{Reliability}
			WORK IN PROGRESS
			The reliability of the system depends mainly in the reliability of used \ic{Smart Wearables} regarding the data collection and in the reliability of the internet connection regarding the sending of data to the centralized system of Data4Help and conseguently to the \ic{Third Parties}.
			\subsection{Availability}
			The system must offer the maximum availability, granting its service 24/7. The lack of service must be minimal.
			\paragraph{AutomatedSOS}
			AutomatedSOS must be active 24/7. The lack of service is acceptable only if it is due to maintenance. AutomatedSOS users must have received a warning fourty-eight hours before, and they must be noticed again one hour before the service disabling. \\
			Even in this case, the lack of service must be kept to a minimum.

			\subsection{Security}
			The system to be does not have particular security concerns except the ones related to privacy. The login of \ic{Users} and especially of \ic{Third Parties} must be very safe (using state of the art login techniques is recommended) to avoid unauthorized individuals to access private information of \ic{Users}. Moreover, the means of communication must be encrypted to save the confidentiality of information sent to Data4Help and to \ic{Third Parties}.
			
			\subsection{Maintainability}
			\todo{TODO....SECONDO ME DA RIMUOVERE}
			
			\subsection{Portability}
			Portability of \textit{User data} from a device to another is possible by entering personal login data, also for devices with different operating systems.
			Personal data and settings are stored in a database and they are downloaded when a new device is connected.
