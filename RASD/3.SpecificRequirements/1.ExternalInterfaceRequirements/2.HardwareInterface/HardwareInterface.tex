\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}
			Data4Help is a service based on native applications for smartphones and on a centralized backend handling the retrieval of data from users and their storage. Data4Help acts only as an intermediary between the sources of data and the parties that want to get access to those. Due to this, Data4Help has no hardware interfaces.\\
			Obviously also the services built on top of it, being pure software adds-on working on top of basic API's of Data4Help, don't have hardware interfaces.
