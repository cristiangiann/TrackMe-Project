\section{Purpose}
			TrackMe offers a basic B2B service named "Data4Help" on top of which are built two B2C services named "AutomatedSOS" and "Track4Run".
			\paragraph{Data4Help:}It's a service that TrackMe company is willing to develop. The basic idea is allowing third parties to monitor the location and health status of Users through many sensors. The service is based on the retrieval of data sent by registered users. Every user has one or more sensor that sends the information to TrackMe. Then, data can be directly sent to a third party client that pays for the service and had obtained the authorization of the user, or can contribute to a anonymous dataset (composed by at least a thousands people due to company policy). Users sending data are rewarded.\\
			
			\paragraph{AutomatedSOS:}It's a service that guarantees (within a certain amount of time - 5 seconds according company policy) the call of an ambulance if the health data that is received is under a given threshold.
			
			\paragraph{Track4Run:}It's a service that it can be used during a running competition: organizers can define a path and runners can enroll to it enabling spectators to track them in a map.
