\section{Purpose\label{sect:1.1}}
			
			TrackMe wants to offer a service named "Data4Help" on top of which two services, named "AutomatedSOS" and "Track4Run", will be built.
			\paragraph{Data4Help:} the basic idea behind Data4Help is to acquire the location and health data of \ic{Users} through a \ic{Smart wearable} connected to their smartphone. Moreover, data can be directly sent to \ic{Third parties}. In order to obtain and analyze \ic{User data}, these need to obtain \ic{User} authorization. Furthermore, they can request anonymized data of a group of \ic{Users}.
			
			\paragraph{AutomatedSOS:} a service offered only to subscribed customers that constantly monitors their health status. Its purpose is to identify when a \ic{User} is in need of immediate assistance and send an ambulance to their location.
			
			\paragraph{Track4Run:} a service used to track runners participating in running competitions. \ic{Organizers} will be able to define a path for the run, \ic{Participants} will share their position and health data and \ic{Spectators} may watch the competition on their smart devices.

			In this document, the goals of the system to be are analyzed through the identification of the needed requirements and domain assumptions.
