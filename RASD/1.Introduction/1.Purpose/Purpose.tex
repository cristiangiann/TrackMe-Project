\section{Purpose}
			
			TrackMe wants to offer a service named "Data4Help" on top of which will be built two services named "AutomatedSOS" and "Track4Run".
			\paragraph{Data4Help:} the basic idea behind Data4Help is to acquire the location and health data of \textit{Users} through \textit{smart wearables} connected to a smartphone. Moreover, data can be directly sent to \textit{Third Party} customers who pay for the service. In order to analyze \textit{Users data}, these need to obtain user authorization. Furthermore, they can request anonymized data of a group of users.
			
			\paragraph{AutomatedSOS:} a service offered only to subscribed customers that constantly monitors their health status. Its purpose is to identify when a \textit{User} is in need of immediate assistance and send an ambulance to their location.
			
			\paragraph{Track4Run:} a service used to track runners participating in running competitions. \textit{Organizers} will be able to define a path for the run, \textit{Participants} will share their position and health data  and \textit{Spectators} may watch the competition on their smart devices.
