		\section{Purpose}
			{\bf Data4Help } is a service that TrackMe company is willing to develop. The basic idea is allowing third parties to monitor the location and health status of individuals through many sensors. The service is based on the retrieval of data sent by registered users. Every user has one or more sensor that sends the information to TrackMe. Then, data can be directly sent to a third party client that pays for the service and had obtained the authorization of the user, or can contirbute to a anonymous dataset (composed by at least a thousands people due to company policy).\\
			On top of Data4Help's infrastructure are built two products that are offered by TrackMe: AutomatedSOS and Track4Run.\\
			\\{\bf AutomatedSOS:} It's a service that guarantees (within a certain amount of time - 5 seconds according company policy) the call of an ambulance if the health data that is received is under a given threshold. \\\\{\bf Track4Run:} It's a service that it can be used during a running competition: organizers can define a path and runners can enroll to it enabling spectators to track them in a map.

		\section{Scope}
			TrackMe offers its services in a world where technology and health are taking huge strides forward every day and innovation is commonplace.\\
Nowadays, people use smart devices such as smartphones and smart wearables more than any other object that they own. This means that any activity they perform already is or can be integrated with these devices.\\
TrackMe, with the introduction of Data4Help, offers the possibility to monitor users’ location and health data and allows third parties to register in the system to acquire these data.\\
When it comes to personal data acquisition, privacy is a fundamental issue that TrackMe needs to consider. Privacy is, in fact, regulated by several laws: there are many restrictions on how user’s data is acquired and stored. Therefore, TrackMe is concerned with users’ consent to transferring data to TrackMe itself and to third parties for individual specific analysis. Moreover, TrackMe guarantees that anonymized data of groups of individuals are properly anonymized by checking specific constraints.\\

Over the course of their daily routine, users perform several actions during which their data can be analyzed to provide them with insights. For instance, they might want to monitor their heart rate while sleeping or to keep track of the distance they have walked during their day and the places they have been to.\\
People with a potential need for immediate assistance have always been a huge concern for their relatives and for technology makers. These may include old people with limited movement and a high chance to need urgent assistance, anyone who has a specific disease, but also a healthy individual who can suffer from a sudden heart failure. Until now, the only practical way to receive help has been to call for help, either by using a cell phone or by pushing an SOS button on a dedicated device. TrackMe proposes to automatize the step of calling for help through AutomatedSOS. In fact, when determined health values will no more be considered as normal, the system will automatically send a request for help.\\
Moreover, a considerable percentage of people work out on a daily basis or simply enjoy being fit through some physical exercise sporadically. Personal trainers can be helpful in providing tips and work out routines that people can follow. Doctors should periodically monitor an individual’s health status, especially if they exercise. However, these not only are expensive but also, most importantly, aren’t always available.\\
A sport practiced and loved by many is running. Organizing a run requires several steps to be taken such as defining a path, getting athletes to participate and spectators to watch it. TrackMe proposes to simplify the organization of a run, by introducing Track4Run. This service will allow the definition of a path, easy enrollment for participants and a real-time tracking of each runner’s position on a map.

			\subsection{Goals}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item[G1] Allow a person to register as Individual after his agreement of acquirement of data by TrackMe.
				
				\item[G2] Allow a person or a company to register as Third Part of Data4Help.

				\item[G3] Manage individual request of a Third Part.\\
				$\left[G3.1\right]$ Allow a Third Part to select a person whom want to access data through his fiscal code or his social security number.\\
				$\left[G3.2\right]$ Allow the Individual to accept or refuse the request.\\
				$\left[G3.3\right]$ If the Individual accept the request, his data are sent to the Third Part which made the request.\\
				$\left[G3.4\right]$ If the Individual does not accept the request, the Third Part which made the request is not able to see his data.
				
				\item[G4] Manage groups of individuals request of a Third Part.\\
				$\left[G4.1\right]$ Allow a Third Part to select a group of people linked by one or more data.\\
				$\left[G4.2\right]$ If the request refers to 1000 Individuals or more, the request is accepted and the data are anonymized before being sent to the Third Part which made the request.\\
				$\left[G4.2\right]$ If the request refers to less than 1000 Individuals, the request is refused and the Third Part is not able to access to the data.
				
				\item[G5] Allow to a Third Part to access to data of Individuals of whom it have permission as soon as they are produced
