 \chapter{User Interface Design}
	All the relevant mockups relative to \ic{User} interface are included in the RASD in section \todo{inserire qu√¨ sezione corretta}.
	\paragraph{How to move between interfaces}
	In this chapter are listed the ways to move through different interfaces to give a clear idea of the navigation paths:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{\ic{Data4Help Welcome Page} is shown when Data4Help app is opened.}
		\item{\ic{Data4Help Welcome Page} redirects as soon as the app is loaded to Data4Help Login Page.}
		\item{\ic{Data4Help Login Page} redirects to Data4Help Sign Up Page if the \ic{User} tap on Sign Up link, or redirects to Data4Help Menu if \ic{User} fill in the form and tap on Login.}
		\item{\ic{Data4Help Sign Up Page } redirects to \ic{Data4Help Login Page} after the \ic{User} fill in the form and tap on Create Account (assuming inserted data are correct). If data is not correct, the interface doesn't change and an alert is shown.}
		\item{\ic{Data4Help Menu} redirects to:}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item{\ic{\ic{User} Services Page} if the \ic{User} tap on My Services.}
				\item{\ic{Services Discovery Page} if the \ic{User} tap on Discover.}
				\item{\ic{Data4Help Login Page} if the \ic{User} tap on Logout.}				
			\end{itemize}
			My Account, My Devices, Settings, Terms and Conditions redirect to specific pages that are not listed in the RASD because are trivial interfaces. 
		\item{\ic{\ic{User} Services Page} redirects to \ic{\ic{User} Subscribed Service Page} when the \ic{User} tap on a service icon.}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item{If the service is AutomatedSOS and the tracking was deacivated due to a previous alarm, the shwn interface is \ic{AutomatesSOSPage}.}
			\end{itemize}
		\item{\ic{Services Discovery Page} redirects to \ic{Add Service Page} when the \ic{User} tap to a service icon.}
		\item{\ic{Organizer Registration Page} is shown when a \ic{User} connects to organizers interface and asks to register as organizer.}
		\item{\ic{New Run Creation Page} is shown when an organizer asks to create a new run.}
		\item{\ic{Runs Discovery Page} is shown when a \ic{User} connects to participants interface and asks to enroll in a run.}
		\item{\ic{Spectaors Run Discovery Page} is shown when a \ic{User} connects to spetators interface and asks to see available runs. It redirects to \ic{Watch Real Time Run Page} when the \ic{User} tap on a run icon.}
	\end{itemize}
