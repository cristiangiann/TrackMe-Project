\section{Deployment View}
	
	This section contains deployment diagrams, whose purpose is to show how the three systems will look like from a physical point of view, both hardware and software, when they will be implemented and delivered.\\
	All three systems will have a central server architecture split in several servers to ensure reliability and availability. A load balancer is included in all three systems to balance the calls from the clients and send them to servers that are the least busy. There are two load balancers for availability. All servers communicate with the relative database through a TCP/IP protocol.\\\\
	\ic{Services} like AutomatedSOS and Track4Run have a Web Server since they need to offer websites to their users: \ic{Users}, \ic{Participants}, \ic{Spectators} and \ic{Organizers}.
