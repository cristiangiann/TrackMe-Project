## Project Description
*TrackMe* is a company that wants to develop a service, *Data4help*, allowing third parties to monitor the location and the health status of individuals. This service supports the registration of users to provide their data and third parties to offer services to them. Third party services can have access to the data of specific individuals (with prior authorization) or to anonymized data of groups of individuals.  
Two services are implemented directly by *TrackMe*. These are *AutomatedSOS*, that monitors some health parameters of subscribed customers and sends an ambulance to their position when some parameter exceeds its thresholds, and *Track4Run*, that tracks athletes participating in runs.

The complete description of the requirements for the Requirements Analysis and Specification document and the Design document can be found in the Chapter 5 of the [Project Specification file](https://github.com/cristiangiann/TrackMe-Project/blob/master/Project-Specification.pdf). Chapter 6 contains some guidelines and the structure of the two documents.
